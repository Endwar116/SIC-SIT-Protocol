# L11 Semantic OS v1.0

**The Operating System for AI Intent**

A pre-intent protocol and inter-model coupling layer that coordinates multiple AI models as a unified cognitive system.

---

## 🎯 What This Is

**L11 Semantic OS** is not another AI wrapper or prompt library.

It's an **operating system for semantic computation** — a protocol that sits at **Layer -1** (before model inference) to:

- Extract and structure user intent
- Route queries based on semantic density
- Coordinate multiple AI models in parallel
- Synthesize outputs into unified responses

**Think of it as TCP/IP for AI coordination.**

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **n8n** (cloud or self-hosted)
- **API Keys**: OpenAI + Anthropic (Claude)
- **5 minutes**

### Installation

1. **Download** [`L11_n8n_Pipeline_Source.json`](./L11_n8n_Pipeline_Source.json)
2. **Import** to n8n (Settings → Import from File)
3. **Configure** API credentials in the workflow nodes
4. **Activate** the workflow
5. **Test** with your webhook URL

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/l11-chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Design a 3-year AI adoption strategy"}'
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### The Architecture

```
User Input
    ↓
L11 Kernel (Intent Extraction)
    ↓
Gravity Gate (Density Check)
    ├─ Low Density → Fast Response (GPT-4o-mini)
    └─ High Density → Multi-Model Council
        ├─ GPT (Structure & Logic)
        ├─ Claude (Narrative & Ethics)
        └─ Convergence Engine → Unified Output
```

### Key Innovations

**1. Layer -1 (Intent Layer)**
- Operates *before* model inference
- Extracts semantic intent, not just keywords
- Enables intelligent routing

**2. Semantic Gravity Model**
- Calculates "intent density" (0.0 - 1.0)
- High-density queries trigger multi-model collaboration
- Low-density queries use fast, cheap models
- **Result**: Automatic cost optimization

**3. Multi-Model Council**
- GPT, Claude, and Gemini process in **parallel**
- Each contributes its strength (structure, narrative, information)
- Convergence engine synthesizes into coherent output
- **Result**: Better than any single model

## 📊 Why This Matters

### Current AI Systems

❌ Every query uses the same expensive model  
❌ Models work in isolation (no collaboration)  
❌ No intelligence in routing or optimization  
❌ High cost, slow response, inconsistent quality  

### L11 Semantic OS

✅ Smart routing based on query complexity  
✅ Multiple models collaborate in real-time  
✅ Automatic cost optimization (50-90% savings)  
✅ High-quality outputs from model synthesis

## 🔬 Core Concepts

### D-Layer: Semantic Physics

**Semantic Gravity Formula:**
```
F_sem = G_sem · (m_A · m_B) / d(A,B)²
```

- **m** = Semantic mass (information density)
- **d** = Semantic distance (embedding space)
- High-gravity concepts get more processing power

**Necessary Vector Bits (NVB):**
The irreducible unit of meaning required to reconstruct intent without loss.

**Intent Tensor Field:**
Multi-dimensional representation spanning:
- Explicit (stated goal)
- Implicit (underlying need)
- Deep (strategic trajectory)
- Constraint (boundaries)

### E-Layer: Engineering Stack

- **L11 Compiler**: Orchestrates parsing, linking, and execution
- **L11 Parser**: Extracts intent and filters noise
- **L11 Linker**: Routes to appropriate models
- **IMCB** (Inter-Model Coupling Band): Prevents semantic drift
- **Convergence Engine**: Synthesizes multi-model outputs
